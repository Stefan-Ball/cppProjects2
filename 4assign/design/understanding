This assignment is asking us to include include functionality for polymorphism for Pokemon GO. We are meant to have base functions for the Pokemon so that we can use polymorphism to write functions that include any Pokemon for upgrading them, capturing them, or battling them. We will have to write scenarios for the polymorphic Pokemon in these situations, which will happen by making a dynamic array of a grid for the user to play on.
